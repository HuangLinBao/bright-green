## Description

This is my first ever web project, developed while undergoing a web development course at the university. I created a dynamic web showcase using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with JQuery for enhanced functionality. The animations were implemented using GSAP, while BarbaJS was leveraged for optimizing HTTP requests. Additionally, CleaveJS was employed for user-friendly number formatting. The backend functionality was implemented using PHP, with MySQL utilized for database management within the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) platform.
